## Pipeline: 

### Step 1: Finding all the Faces

- HOG -> Histograms of Oriented Gradients
- HOG Image conversion
- HOG image compression
- To find faces in this HOG image, all we have to do is find the part of our image that looks the most similar to a known HOG pattern that was extracted from a bunch of other training faces

### Step 2: Posing and Projecting Faces


### Step 3: Encoding Faces

### Step 4: Finding the personâ€™s name from the encoding
